	<div class="text"><p> Blown Away is a Canadian reality glassblowing competition television series that premiered on the streaming platform Netflix. The 10-episode first season was released on July 12, 2019. The series is filmed in Canada and was produced by Marblemedia.<br>

<br>The contestants on the show comprise 10 glassblowers. <br> 
		
<br>Nick Uhas, a former Big Brother U.S contestant and science YouTuber, hosts the show, while Katherine Gray, an artist and professor at California State University, San Bernardino is the chief judge. <br> 
		
<br>The winner receives a $60,000 prize and an artist residency at the Corning Museum of Glass. The first season was filmed in a facility that was "custom-built to accommodate 10 glass blowers working simultaneously". <br> 
		
<br>Industry experts from the Craft and Design Glass Studio at Sheridan College, Pilchuck Glass School, and the Corning Museum of Glass consulted the producers during the construction of the facility and provide advice and evaluation to the contestants each round.</p></div>
