	<h3>1. What is glass?   (10/27/2018) </h3> 
	<img src="glass3.png" "Pic" border="5" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px"> 
		<div class="description"><p> Pictured here is what we call a "glory hole". A giant furnace that can reach a temperature of 2,000 degrees.</p></div>
	<p>The Great Glass Gallery was created in 2019 as a means to connect ordinary people whom are interested in the art of glass.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">Believe it or not, glass is made from liquid sand. You can make glass by heating ordinary sand (which is mostly made of silicon dioxide) until it melts and turns into a liquid. <br><br> You won't find that happening on your local beach: sand melts at the incredibly high temperature of 1700°C (3090°F)When molten sand cools, it doesn't turn back into the gritty yellow stuff you started out with: it undergoes a complete transformation and gains an entirely different inner structure. <br><br> But it doesn't matter how much you cool the sand, it never quite sets into a solid. Instead, it becomes a kind of frozen liquid or what materials scientists refer to as an amorphous solid. It's like a cross between a solid and a liquid with some of the crystalline order of a solid and some of the molecular randomness of a liquid.</span></p>

	<br><h3>2. BulletProof Glass   (10/28/2018) </h3> 
	<img src="Bulletproof.png" "Pic" border="5" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 100px"> 
		<div class="description1"><p> Pictured here is bulletproof glass that has been shot at.</p></div>
	<p>Bulletproof glass (ballistic glass, transparent armor, and bullet-resistant glass) is a strong and optically transparent material that is particularly resistant to penetration by projectiles. Like any other material, it is not completely impenetrable.  <span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1"><br><br>It is usually made from a combination of two or more types of glass, one hard and one soft[citation needed]. The softer layer makes the glass more elastic, so it can flex instead of shatter. Bulletproof glass is used in windows of buildings that require such security, such as jewelry stores and embassies, and of military and private vehicles. <br><br>Bullet-resistant materials are tested using a gun to fire a projectile from a set distance into the material, in a specific pattern. Levels of protection are based on the ability of the target to stop a specific type of projectile traveling at a specific speed.</span></p>
